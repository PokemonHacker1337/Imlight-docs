# Game Internals

These documents are written by the developer team of Revive101, but remain public as a banklet of knowledge.
The developer team's understandings of reverse engineering are provided in detail in the pages that follow.

Our effort aims to comprehend the game client's fundamental design and workings so that we may develop tools, tweaks, and eventually emulation.

::: warning
Please be aware that unless otherwise stated, all written documentation is presumed to be understood. Having said that, these systems have been studied through compiled binaries, and they are open to correction or modification when the game updates.
